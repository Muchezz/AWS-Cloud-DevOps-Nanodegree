# Cloud DevOps Engineer - Nanodegree
The following are the topics and technologies learnt during the nano degree program.

1.  Cloud Foundations
Learn the fundamentals of cloud computing while being introduced to compute power, 
security, storage, networking, messaging, and management services in the cloud.


2. Deploy Infrastructure as Code (IAC) - [project 2](https://github.com/Muchezz/AWS-Cloud-DevOps-Nanodegree/tree/main/project_2)
In this course, i learned how to deploy the underlying infrastructure components 
that provide security and services to our servers by writing scripts using CloudFormation, 
AWS’ tool for Infrastructure as Code. I used CloudFormation to deploy Infrastructure 
patterns that are used in the industry broadly and can be readily used to deploy any cloud 
application. Like in the real world, I began with initial business requirements that 
turned into Cloud Architecture Diagrams. Then I deployed this architecture using 
CloudFormation.

3. Build CI/CD Pipelines, Monitoring & Logging - [project 3](https://github.com/Muchezz/AWS-Cloud-DevOps-Nanodegree/tree/main/project_3)
I learned how to stretch for Continuous Delivery as the “true north” while I build CI/CD systems
 that automate the “stuff” between developers and the cloud. I gain essential knowledge and 
 put it into practice as I learned about Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. 
 I combined the knowledge of Cloud Formation and AWS with new tools like Ansible 
 and Circle CI. I also learned how to keep an eye on your deployments with proactive monitoring and alerting.

4. Microservices at Scale using Kubernetes - [project 4](https://github.com/Muchezz/AWS-Cloud-DevOps-Nanodegree/tree/main/project_4)
In this course, I learned to create and deploy a kubernetes cluster, configure kubernetes autoscale and load test
 a kubernetes application. I learned to operationalize both existing and new microservices and apply containers 
 best practices. I learned to deploy Machine Learning microservices that are elastic and fault tolerant. 
 I learned to pick the appropriate abstraction for microservices: Serverless (AWS Lambda) or Container Orchestration (Kubernetes).

 5. Project Capstone  - [project 5](https://github.com/Muchezz/AWS-Cloud-DevOps-Nanodegree/tree/main/project_5-Capstone-Cloud-DevOps)
 I Buildt a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices application with rolling deployment strategy. I also developed my Continuous 
 Integration steps including typographical checking (aka “linting”). Using Circle CI, I pushed the built Docker container(s)
 to both the Docker repository and the AWS ECR. I then deployed these Docker container(s) to a small Kubernetes cluster using the 
 AWS Kubernetes as a Service(EKS).
